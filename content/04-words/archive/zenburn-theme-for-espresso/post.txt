Text: I wanted a subtle/dark color scheme for my current IDE of choice [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/ "Espresso editor by MacRabbit")Â but being as fussy as I am, nothing I found was quite right, so I ended up creating my own one roughly based on the popular [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ "Zenburn") color scheme which I find is nice and easy on the eyes. 

You can download a copy (file:Zenburn.css.zip). Of course you want a preview so here's a simple PHP/HTML page
