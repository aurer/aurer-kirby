Description:
Built using the Drupal framework, this installation consists of a simple Drupal site with art directed pages centered around product guide, news and information about the brewery itself.

The site features rich, full width imagery and in-line videos as well as a product guide and news listing.

The build time was around 4 weeks from initial installation to go live. Working along side the lead developer and designer I was responsible for creating custom templates and realising the design though a custom Drupal theme.
