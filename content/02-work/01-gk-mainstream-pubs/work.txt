Description:
Built using the Drupal framework, this multi-site installation consists of around 100 pub sites all managed through a single Drupal installation. The build time was around 7 weeks from initial installation to go live.

Each pubs site can be customised with location specific promotions, menus and imagery.

Working along side the lead developer and designer I was responsible for installing Drupal, configuring and modifying required modules, creating custom templates and realising the design though a custom Drupal theme.
