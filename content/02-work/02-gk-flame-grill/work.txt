Description:
Built using the Drupal framework, this installation consists of a central hub search page leading to around 100 pub sites all managed through a single Drupal installation.

The hub site uses the Geolocation API to find pubs near the user, the search results are shown on a map and in list form along with a little information about the pub.

The build time was around 6 weeks from initial installation to go live. Working along side the lead developer and designer I was responsible for installing Drupal, configuring and modifying required modules, creating custom templates and realising the design though a custom Drupal theme.
