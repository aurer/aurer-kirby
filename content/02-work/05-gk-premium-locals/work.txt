Description:
Built using the Drupal framework, this multi-site installation consists of around 100 pub sites all managed through a single Drupal installation. The build time was around 10 weeks from initial installation to go live.

Each pub site can be customised with a choice of 4 themes, each with a dark and a light version. Each site features bright full width imagery along with Instagram feeds, menus and a gallery.

Working with another front-end developer and the lead developer and designer I was responsible for configuring and modifying required modules, creating custom templates and realising the design though 4 custom Drupal themes all sharing a common parent.
