## About me
My name is Phil Maurer, I am a full-time web developer with a background in design, living and working in Suffolk, England. I have been working in web design and development for around 5 years, and I love every day of it.

### Background
Iâ€™ve always had a great appreciation for good design, I studied graphic design in college through to a degree before branching into web design. From the design side of the web I quickly became interested in development and taught myself the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, building small sites for friends and relatives.

Eventually that helped me land a junior position in a web agency, and from that point on I expanded into other web technologies, and I continue to learn new things every day.
