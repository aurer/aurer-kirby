Another few months and another little project, this time a code snippet manager. I obviously have no imagination for thinking up web apps as there’s loads of these things around, however it seems a good sort of project to help with learning a framework.

This one is built using the awesome [CodeIgniter framework](http://codeigniter.com/). If you havent heard of it I strongly suggest you have a read through the documentation and give it a go, the documentation is superb, it’s really easy to find things and doesn’t leave anything out.Codeigniter also has a big community of helpful devs, just google your query and chances are someone will have already answered it.

So what was this web app meant to do:

Allow me to quickly add and store code snippets.
Categorise the clips using tags, I find that I often want to categorise code under more than a single language e.g PHP and Regex or HTML and Javascript.
Quickly search for snippets.
Keep track of my most recent and popular clips for fast access.
I thought that maybe if I could get this working well enough I could add user login and private clips etc. and actually release it to the world but that is a LOT more work than it seems at first.
